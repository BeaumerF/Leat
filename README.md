# Leat
The But of Leat (portmanteau of the words « Lie » and «Cheat») game is to get rid as soon as possible of all the cards we have in hand.
Players turn a card over the previous one, but face down, announcing a value at the top like "8Trefle 9Carreau" or "8Trefle 8Trefle".
When one of the players to a suspicion on the card announced by the player coming to put the card, he must say  "/lie"
If the player who posed the card lied, he has to pick up all the piles of accumulated cards.
If the player did not lie, the one who announced "/lie" picks up all the cards from the heap.
